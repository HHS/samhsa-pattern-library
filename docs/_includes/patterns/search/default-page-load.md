## Search Page functionality – onLoad
On page load, content is sorted by Latest Published and 15 items are displayed.

There are three types of incoming searches, canned, keyword, empty.

### Empty -
- a user submits an empty search (search from with blank input field)

### Keyword -
- Any search using the search widget, results are constrained to keyword matches.

#### Typos and Misspellings
- The system should have a list of common misspellings and would load results against the list.

### Canned -
- A canned search is a link created anywhere in the site that contains search filiter criteria. When used, the filter set is contrained by any applied options (keywords and filters). Filters show as buttons in the applied filiters bar and are marked in the filters (however filter accordions stay closed). Keywords show in the search return text.
