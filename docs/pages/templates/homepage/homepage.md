## Authoring
Every element of the home page should be authored through a single content interface (except for Get Help). Author's will create the item they want and then direct it to the area on the page it is intending to go. Choosing a placement will make the current item in that placement inactive -- there should be a warning before commiting.

**Creating options**
1- Authors can create a brand new element be filling out the content form.

2- Authors should be able to pull the content elements from an internal destination using a url. Once the items are pulled into the form, the author's will be able to edit and save.

3- Authors can look through past (inactive) items and reactive them.


**Get Help**
Is a static component and is not authored. Please see more about [Get Help]({{ site.url }}/cards/#get-help-card).
