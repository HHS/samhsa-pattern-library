The Resource Center experience was created for programs and centers to house their content and resources. The experience is meant to create a common structure that is easier to manage for both authoring and development, but also to create a consistent user experience. The first two resources making use of this experience are the Evidence Based Practices Resource Center (EBRPC) and Disaster Behavioral Health Information Series (DBHIS). 

The resources for the centers will be made available through global search, and through an internal search in the program area. The program experience consist of both a landing page which list the resources and a detail page which will can more information before directing the user to the resource.

## Taxonomy

The taxonomy terms help categorize and filter the list of resources provided by each center. When designing a resource center page, the filters should appear in order of importance:
1. Category (i.e. the Research Center's specific terms)
2. Issues, Conditions, & Disorders
3. Substances
4. Populations
5. Treatment, Prevention, & Recovery
6. Professional & Research Topics
7. Resource Type
8. Sources

Please note that while all the non-center-specific terms are available to everyone for use, not every resource center opts to use them. For example, a center can decide not to tag their resources with Professional & Research Topics tags.
