## Overview
Accordions are a list of elements that allow for hiding and showing content when selected. This is a helpful way to group like content while still keeping the page clean and cognitively manageable. Accordions are especially useful for long forms or for smaller screen devices. A single accordion is a good way to hide content on small screens, like page filters, that would otherwise be in the way.
